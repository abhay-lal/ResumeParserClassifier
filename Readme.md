# ResumeParser-Classifier system
## About Project:
This project is broadly divided into two sections: the Resume Parser and then the Recommendation System. For the Resume Parser, the raw text will be extracted from resumes and blocks would be isolated along with the separation of entities. The model continues to extract data from resumes that straightforwardly contribute toward the determination of the best candidate. 
We will also be designing an automated machine learning-based model for the recommendation system that will recommend acceptable candidate's resumes to HR based on the job description provided by the firm. The suggested approach will be divided into two phases: first, it will categorize resumes into several groups. Secondly, it will suggest a resume based on a similarity index to the job description provided.


## Uses:
*   To help users find better opportunitites in the job market by looking at the details of their resume. 
*   What kind of job might be the most appropriate and where the seekeers could find them is the base problem we are trying to solve.
