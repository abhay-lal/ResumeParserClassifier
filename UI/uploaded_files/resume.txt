Projects 

DeepFake Detection 

Developed a tool to detect deepfake videos using an RNN and Lucas-Kanade 
equation for optical flow. 

GUILD [Generating Useful Insights Using Large Datasets]  

Built a data categorization tool to assign categories to documents and then extract 
information about these categories in an unsupervised manner. 
Used ALBERT, auto-encoder for dimensionality reduction, optimized K-Means and 
hierarchical LDA for topic extraction. 

Deblurring Using GAN 

Deblurred images in GoPro dataset using a GAN. 

Email Spam Detection Using Spark Streaming & Incremental 
Learning 

Classified emails in Enron spam detection dataset using SparkML in python. 
Data was live streamed in batches using Spark and ML models were trained in an 
incremental way to train each batch as it was streamed.  

Stock Market Analysis  

Simulated real time stock market trading environment and provided 
recommendations on stocks to purchase based on recent trends. 

Network Attacks Detection 

Detected Network Attacks using various classical ML algorithms. 

Password Manager 

Developed a Password manager tool using MERN stack. 

Personal Information Manager 

Using Secure-C practices developed a tool to store users personal information by 
encrypting data using Caesar cipher.
