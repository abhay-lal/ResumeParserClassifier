Developed a tool to detect deepfake videos using an RNN and Lucas-Kanade 
equation for optical flow. 

GUILD [Generating Useful Insights Using Large Datasets]  

Built a data categorization tool to assign categories to documents and then extract 
information about these categories in an unsupervised manner. 
Used ALBERT, auto-encoder for dimensionality reduction, optimized K-Means and 
hierarchical LDA for topic extraction.

PERSONAL PROJECTS 
Astro Numbers (07/2021 - 08/2021)

Have built a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) model using Tensorﬂow to recognise handwritten
digits. 
Astro numbers help primary teachers to give the students a unique
experience in solving maths problems. 
The web based application deployed on Heroku interface of Astro
numbers uses a MLP model to classify the answers drawn by
students. 

Bitcoin Price Prediction (12/2021 - 01/2022)

In this Deep Learning Application, have used the price data for
Bitcoin to forecast its price in a speciﬁed future window. We have
used the Tensorﬂow and Keras APIs to build a stacked LSTM model. 
The user can check the candlestick graph that displays the
high,low,open,close of Bitcoin [BTC]. 
This project is deployed on Streamlit ,the user can select the weeks.
