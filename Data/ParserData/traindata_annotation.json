The disease can be treated if detected early, but if not, it can lead to irreversible blindness.\n\nOne of the most common ways to detect diabetic eye disease is to have a specialist examine pictures of the back of the eye and determine whether there are signs of the disease, and if so, how severe it is.\n\nOur client who is a leading hospital in china, provided us a dataset of 128,000 images and used them to train a deep neural network to detect diabetic retinopathy. \n\nWe have used deep learning platform CNTK and Microsoft azure to build the model.\nWe then compared our algorithm�s performance to another set of images examined by a panel of board-certified ophthalmologists. Our algorithm performs on par with the ophthalmologists, achieving both high sensitivity and specificity. \n\n\nCredit card fraud detection\n\n\nAlthough there are several fraud detection technology exist based on Data mining, Knowledge Discovery and Expert System etc. but all these are not capable enough to detect the fraud at the time when fraudulent transaction are in progress due to very less chance of a transaction being fraudulent .

Multiple locomotives in the area receive these messages and PTC application uses them as part of its operation. Since more than one locomotive may be interested in a WIU�s message, the status message is sent in a broadcast mode at the radio level. The PTC application on the locomotive needs the message a specified distance ahead of the wayside location. This poses some unique challenges such as:-\nWayside 220 radios may not cover the needed distance of track. And, parts or the entire 220 MHz radio network may fail and the wayside currently has no ability to leverage locomotive�s wireless IP networks.\nHACC as an application solves the above challenges through:-220MHz Radio Base Station relay & failover � which improves 220 Network reliability and track coverage.  On    demand dynamic subscriptions,   where by wayside status messages can be delivered by WSRS to locomotive over any available network � to mitigate failures in the 220 radio network.

Structural measurements of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), and macular and ganglion cell layer (GCL) thicknesses, were obtained using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Comparison of obtained data, and correlation analysis between functional and structural results were performed.\nResults: VA (in all different contrast levels) and all CSV spatial frequencies were significantly worse in patients with PD than in controls. Colour vision was significantly affected based on the Lanthony colour test. Significant GCL loss was observed in the minimum GCL+inner plexiform layer. A clear tendency towards a reduction in several macular sectors (central, outer inferior, outer temporal and superior (inner and outer)) and in the temporal quadrant of the RNFL thickness was observed, although the difference was not significant. CSV was the functional parameter most strongly correlated with structural measurements in PD. Colour vision was associated with most GCL measurements. Macular thickness was strongly correlated with macular volume and functional parameters (r>0.70, p<0.05).\nConclusions: Patients with PD had visual dysfunction that correlated with structural changes evaluated by SD-OCT. GCL measurements may be reliable indicators of visual impairment in patients with PD.\nRoles and responsibilities:\nModeling: Design and implement statistical / predictive models and cutting edge algorithms utilizing diverse sources of data to predict demand, risk and price elasticity.

Unlike downloaded media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the media in smaller batches, directly from the source. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the data (such as a movie) before the entire file has been transmitted. This is known as streaming media.\nTitle:\n\n\nTAG ( March 2016 to April 2016)\nCompany:\n\nJaarwis Labs Ltd.\n\nTechnology:                   Django 1.7, Python\nApplication link:\nhttp://www.tag.care/\n\nDescription:                 TAG is a Global Real-Time Location Identification device – all that means is that                                                                                 it keeps an eye on what matters most to you.

It is used to generate a Unique Product key for every newly created product. The generated product key can be changed by the user. The system will accept or reject the modified product key based on the algorithm used. There are 3 algorithms used for the product key generation:\nUsing Patterns:\nThis algorithm used has 3 combinations for product key generation: Caps only-product key with only CAP\nNumbers only-product key with only number Mixed-product key with mixed caps and numbers. Hash Algorithm\nThe hash algorithm uses java’s inbuilt hash algorithm techniques to generate the product key. This uses the customer information to prepare the seed to generate the hash algorithm based product key. If the customer information has changed it gives a new seed for the hash algorithm. When the user tried to change the product key generated, the PDK will check if the new product key is backtracked to the original seed, if it does, the new product code is accepted. If not the user is given an error message.\nUUID Algorithm\nUUID stands for Universal Unique ID. It generates a unique the product key based on java’s inbuilt UUID. The generated product key is tested based on the Regular expression. If the user tries to change the product key, PDK checks for the regular expression and accepts or rejects the new product key.\n\n\tContribution\n\t1.Requirement analysis and enhancement\n\n\n\t\n\t2.

EBM aims to apply the best available evidence gained from scientific method to medical decision-making.it seeks to access the quality of evidence of risks and benefits of treatments(including lack of treatment).\n\nEBM exists on two levels: the institutional level (for large healthcare groups, hospitals, etc) and the individual level. On the institutional level, guidelines and standards of care are established for members of the institution to follow according to evidence-based medicine. On the individual level, the health care provider (HCP) may rely more on the evidence of a collective group. The aim is to develop a program that allows individual HCPs to draw on the collective wisdom of thousands of other HCPs, thus allowing individual HCPs to practice EBM on the institutional level without actually being associated with an institution. it will also allow institution to establish best practice methods based on  the data we collect, instead of accumulating the data themselves.\n\nThe main aim of CEBM (Collaborative Evidence-Based Medicine) will collect data on a granular level for thousand of diseases. It will be an open platform for HCPs to input data based on their experience and wisdom. By consulting specialists on each disease we define, we will collect the best evidence for diagnosis and treatment of each disease in our database.\n \n\n· Organization\t\t:\tOmnie solutions India Pvt Ltd,(Noida)\n· Project title\t\t:\tUnleash Inc\n· Designation\t\t:\tWeb Developer\n· Team Members\t:\t4\n· Role\t\t\t:\tDevelopment\n· Languages/Tools\t:\tCold Fusion, Java Script, AJAX, aspEasyPDF\n· Database\t\t:\tSQL-Server 2000.\n· Time Duration\t:\t15 July 2008 to 19 Feb 2010\n· Module Worked\t:\tMarketing Plan, MSP, NEWACTION PLAN, and User                                           \nInformation.\n  \nDescription:\nUnleash main objective is to give customize solutions to their various client.
